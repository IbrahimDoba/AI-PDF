Geophysical and geochemical techniques have proven to be valuable tools in understanding the subsurface geology and identifying potential mineral deposits.\n2.1 Geology\nGeology is the scientific study of the Earth's history, processes, materials, and structure. It encompasses a broad range of disciplines, including mineralogy, petrology, geomorphology, paleontology, and tectonics. Geologists investigate the formation and evolution of the Earth and its natural resources, such as minerals, rocks, and fossil fuels.\n2.2 Geochemistry\nGeochemical analyses of rock samples, soil, and surface water play a significant role in identifying anomalies related to mineralization. By studying the elemental composition, especially trace elements, researchers can pinpoint potential areas for mineral exploration.\n2.3 Aero magnetic data interpretation\nAeromagnetic surveys provide valuable information about the distribution of magnetic minerals and geological structures beneath the Earth's surface. By interpreting aeromagnetic data, researchers can identify potential ore bodies and gain insights into the geological controls of mineralization. The high-resolution aeromagnetic survey conducted over the FUT Minna Gidan Kwano Campus area offers a promising opportunity to detect magnetic anomalies associated with mineral deposits.\nCHAPTER THREE\n3.0        Methodology\nAeromagnetic Data Acquisition and Interpretation:\nArrange an airborne magnetic survey to collect high-resolution aeromagnetic data for the study area.\nProcess and analyze the aeromagnetic data using appropriate software and techniques to identify magnetic anomalies.\nii. Fieldwork and Geological Mapping:\nConduct field surveys to verify and update existing geological information in the study area.\nCreate detailed geological maps, noting rock types, structures, and potential mineralization occurrences.\niii. Geochemical Sampling and Analysis:\nDesign a systematic sampling program to collect rock samples from key geological units and areas of interest.\nAnalyze the collected rock samples in a laboratory to determine their elemental composition, particularly trace elements associated with mineralization.\n            3.1 Materials and equipment\nMaterials:\nRock samples: samples are collected during geological fieldwork and are crucial for understanding the lithology, mineralogy, and structural characteristics of the rocks present in the area\nSediment samples: Sediment samples are collected from riverbeds, lake bottoms, or other depositional environments found at the study site.\nSoil samples: Soil samples are collected from the upper layer of the Earth's surface and consist of a mixture of mineral particles, organic matter, water, and air.\nTopographic maps: Topographic maps are detailed maps that represent the three-dimensional features of the Earth's surface in a two-dimensional format.\nEquipment:\nGeological hammer: For collecting rock samples and studying rock structures.\nHand lens: To examine mineralogical features and identify minerals in the field.\nGPS (Global Positioning System): For accurate location mapping during field surveys.\nCompass or Clinometer: For measuring strike and dip of rock layers and structural features.\nNotebooks and field books: For recording observations, measurements, and geological descriptions.\nGeological maps and topographic maps: To aid in navigation and interpreting the geological context.\nSample bags and containers: To store and transport collected rock samples to the laboratory.\nCHAPTER FOUR\n4.0        Result interpretation \nGeology and Structural Analysis:\nThe geological mapping and structural analysis provided insights into the distribution of rock units and identified significant geological structures, such as faults and folds.\nAeromagnetic Data Interpretation:\nThe aeromagnetic data interpretation involved the processing and analysis of magnetic anomalies. High-intensity anomalies were associated with magnetic minerals, indicating potential ore bodies.\nGeochemical Analysis:\nThe geochemical analysis of rock, soil, and sediment samples focused on identifying pathfinder elements and anomalous concentrations related to mineralization.\nData Integration:\nThe integration of geology, aeromagnetic data, and geochemistry played a pivotal role in identifying prospective zones for mineral exploration.\n4.1 Software Used\nGeographic Information System (GIS) Software:\nGIS software, such as ArcGIS or QGIS, was used for spatial data integration and mapping.\nPetrographic Software:\nPetrographic software, like ImageJ or Petroledge, was employed for the analysis of thin sections prepared from rock samples.\nGeochemical Analysis Software:\nSpecialized software, such as ICP-MS data processing software (e.g., ICP-MS MassHunter) or spectrophotometry analysis software, was used for processing and interpreting geochemical data from rock, soil, and sediment samples.\nOasis Montaj:\nOasis Montaj is a widely used geophysical software suite that facilitates the processing, visualization, and interpretation of aeromagnetic data.\nCHAPTER FIVE\n5.0        Conclusion\nThe mineralization assessment project conducted at FUT Minna Gidan Kwano Campus has provided valuable insights into the geological context and mineralization potential of the study area.
